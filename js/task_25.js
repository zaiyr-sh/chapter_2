//Object can inherit its behavior from another object by cloning its prototype object:
ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);
//Then the ChildObject received its own methods by chaining them onto its prototype:
ChildObject.prototype.methodName = function() {...}
//It's possible to override an inherited method. Override the fly() method for Penguin so that it returns "I can't fly, I swim."
function Bird() { }
Bird.prototype.fly = function() { return "I am flying!"; };
function Penguin() { }
Penguin.prototype = Object.create(Bird.prototype);
Penguin.prototype.constructor = Penguin;
// Add your code below this line
// Add your code above this line
let penguin = new Penguin();
console.log(penguin.fly()); // Should print "I can't fly, I swim."
